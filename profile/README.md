# 🔬 Bead Project: Reproducible Computational Research Made Simple

Welcome to the Bead Project! We're building tools to solve the **reproducibility crisis** in computational research by making it easy to track, share, and reproduce data-driven analyses.

## 🎯 What is Bead?

**Bead** is a command-line tool that packages your computational workflows into self-contained, versioned units called "beads." Each bead follows the fundamental pattern:

```
output = code(*inputs)
```

Every day, researchers ask themselves:
- *"What exact version of the data did we use?"*
- *"How do we reproduce this result?"*
- *"Which code did we run?"*
- *"What happened to our intermediate files?"*

Bead answers these questions by creating **immutable snapshots** of your complete computational environment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Immutable & Versioned**: Every bead save creates a new timestamped archive
- **🌐 Language Agnostic**: Works with Python, R, Stata, Shell scripts, or any tool that uses files
- **📁 Local-First**: No servers required - works completely offline with simple directory storage
- **🔗 Dependency Tracking**: Explicit input management with content verification
- **👥 Team Friendly**: Easy sharing via file systems, network drives, or manual transfer
- **📦 Human Readable**: Standard zip archives accessible even without bead tools

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install bead (see main repository for detailed installation instructions)
# Note: Requires Python 3.10+
python -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install git+https://github.com/bead-project/bead

# Create a new computational workspace
bead new my-analysis
cd my-analysis

# Add your code and data
echo "print('Hello reproducible world!')" > src/analyze.py
python src/analyze.py > output/results.txt

# Save as an immutable bead
bead save my-project-box
```

## 🎯 Who Should Use Bead?

### Perfect For:
- **Data Scientists** tracking analysis versions and dependencies
- **Research Teams** collaborating on computational projects
- **Academic Researchers** ensuring reproducible publications
- **Analysts** managing complex data processing pipelines

### Common Use Cases:
- Source data collection and versioning
- Multi-step data processing workflows
- Collaborative research with shared dependencies
- Long-term project reproducibility
- Human-in-the-loop analysis workflows

## 🛠 What Bead Does (and Doesn't Do)

### ✅ Bead DOES:
- Manage files and their dependencies with content verification
- Create immutable snapshots of computational workflows
- Enable deterministic recreation of results
- Provide audit trails for scientific workflows

### ❌ Bead DOESN'T:
- Run your code (you control execution)
- Manage software dependencies (use conda, pip, etc.)
- Provide cloud storage (you choose where to store bead boxes)
- Replace your development environment (use your preferred tools)

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get involved:

1. **Try Bead** - Download and test it with your workflows
2. **Share Feedback** - Report bugs or suggest improvements
3. **Contribute Code** - Submit pull requests to improve the tool
4. **Spread the Word** - Help other researchers discover reproducible workflows

## 🏛 Philosophy

> *"Bead is moving files, but that's it."*

Bead is intentionally **minimal and focused** - it manages files and their relationships, leaving everything else to you and your preferred tools. This makes it:
- **Universally applicable** across all computational domains
- **Non-intrusive** to existing workflows  
- **Future-proof** as technologies change
- **Simple to understand** and debug
